This is definitely a point well taken and we have added the requested figure
and a discussion to the text. In the text, we argue that the more
interesting metric is the transit detection efficiency as a function of
magnitude---since our goal is, of course, to find planet candidates---but it
is certainly interesting and useful to include this plot.
We have added a figure and discussion to section 5 (Performance).

It's true that the choice of 150 basis vectors is pretty arbitrary so we have
added an expanded discussion of the factors affecting this choice. It's also a
good point that the "box" model that we use for the transits is not a
formally correct model so there is a risk of distorting the transit. That
being said, in practice, this model is better representation of a transit than
nothing at all. This means that over-fitting is much less of a problem, even
if it is still possible. It's also worth remembering that in the transit fit
step, we do use a physical model of the transit so at that point in the
analysis the model is nearly exact.

To respond to this comment, we have weakened the wording in the text and added
a figure to demonstrate that, even though the model is wrong, the systematics
model doesn't over-fit and distort the transits. This figure also responds to
the next point so we'll describe it more below.

We have added a figure and a discussion in section 3. The figure shows the
effects of applying the model naively to a light curve with an injected
transit and compares it to the results of the simultaneous fit. This figure
also shows the result of using a smaller number of eigenvectors (less
over-fitting but it also doesn't remove enough of the systematics).

Fixed. Thanks for catching this.

We use nearest-neighbor interpolation and we have specified this in the text.

We agree that this was an unnecessary complication and we have removed this
new term. Instead we just stick to discussing the BIC directly.

There has as of yet been no indication that the false positive rate
predictions of Morton & Johnson (2011) or Fressin (2013) are incorrect.
Santerne (2012) focused on a sub-sample of short-period giant candidates, in
which they found a higher FP rate (as expected). There is nothing about that
study, however, that suggests anything is incorrect in the FP predictions in
other parts of planet candidate parameter space. To the contrary, Desert
(2015) has recently released results of a large observational campaign based
mostly on Spitzer photometry, confirming observationally these predictions of
a generally low FP rate.
